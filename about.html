<h2> About the Artist<h2>
  
  <p> My name is Sophia Gilbert and I am a sophomore Graphic Design Student At Emmanuel College. This Web Gallery of analog photos showcases a collection of images taken over the course of early 2020. Focusing on portraiture as well as high contrast black and white images, these photos illistrate the lull presceding the COVID-19 pandemic. <p>
